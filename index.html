        <p>Seals range in size from the 1 m (3 ft 3 in) and 45 kg (99 lb) Baikal seal to the 5 m (16 ft) and 
            3,200 kg (7,100 lb) southern elephant seal male. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that
             are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible
              and agile. Most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 
              They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt 
              or escape from predators, such as sharks and orcas. Seals mainly live in marine environments
               but can also be found in freshwater. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a
                few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals.</p>
